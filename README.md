# Angular Resume
### By [Phil Spelman](http://philspelman.com)


## Run Locally
- Run `yarn install` and wait for packages to install
- Run `yarn start` to compile and serve locally

## Dev Notes:
- the resume should remain responsive
- if you want to print a version of the resume to a PDF that can be a bit tricky
  - Pro tip: attempt to print to a custom sized PDF and change the page length until you achieve a single-page print out
